## My Personal Python, Linux, and Git Bootcamp!

Welcome to my own personal Python, Linux, and Git Bootcamp repository! This repository has been created specifically for me to help me learn these skills and improve coding abilities or learn them as a beginner. I will be using Vim as the main code editor (because I hate myself and VSCode looks boring... joking but I want to learn Linux so everything in this repository will be done from the command line)


### Courses Used
- 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023
- The Git & Github Bootcamp
- Learn Linux in 5 Days and Level Up Your Career


### Python Files
The Python files folder will be split into three sections:

- Beginner (day 1 to 14)
- Intermediate (day 15 to day 57)
- Advanced topics (day 58 to 100)
